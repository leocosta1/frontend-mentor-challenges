## ðŸ’¡ About Frontend Mentor

Frontend Mentor is a very nice platform to improve your frontend coding skills (HTML, CSS, JS, APIs, etc.).

You can choose a challenge, download the initial files, and after completing the coding, submit your solution on the platform, which provides a community feedback tool.
